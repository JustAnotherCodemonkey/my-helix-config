# My Configuration for Helix

[JustAnotherCodemonkey](https://github.com/JustAnotherCodemonkey)'s personal configurations for [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix).

I put these here

1. So that others can see what I'm using in any videos / streams I do and
2. So that others can use my configuration as a sort of Helix starter kit if they like.

Consider this an invitation to do whatever you like with this: use it, share it, personalize it, I don't care. If you do end up using it or a derivative and share that with others though, I'd definitely appreciate a shout-out and a link to the official GH repo (https://github.com/JustAnotherCodemonkey/my-helix-config) for others to use as well.

All distributions of these files should include a copy of this readme file in them.

Just as legal insurance, although these are the configurations I personally directly use on _my_ machine, and there is no reason for them to cause anything worse than an unwanted nuisance that may require restoring previous versions of your config files, if these configuration files in any way mess up anything on _your_ machine, I cannot be held legally responsible.
